A Minecraft resource pack that provides **French translations** for [Cobblemon](https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon).

## ✨ Features

- Complete French translations synced with the official Cobblemon mod
- **Automatically updated** daily from Cobblemon's repository
- Version matched with Cobblemon releases

## 📦 Installation

1. Download from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/cobblemon-french)
2. Place the `.zip` in your `resourcepacks` folder
3. Enable it in-game: **Options → Resource Packs**
4. Keep your Minecraft language set to **English (US)**

## 🔄 How it works

This pack replaces `en_us.json` with Cobblemon's official French translations (`fr_fr.json`). This gives you French Pokémon names, items, and UI while using English Minecraft.
